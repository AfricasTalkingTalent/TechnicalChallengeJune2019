# How to run the program in task 2
The program runs wholly on the sandbox app. Therefore, a few steps have to be taken to enable communication between the server running on your local host and the online emulator.
After cloning the repo:
1. Install the dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file in the task2 folder

2. Install Ngrok to enable testing of the application without deployment:
    Download Ngrok at https://ngrok.com/, and sign up to get an auth token
    Unzip the file at /usr/local/bin
    Run the command "./ngrok-stable-linux-amd64 authtoken (your authtoken)"
    Configure Ngrok to forward requests to port 5000 by entering the command "ngrok http 5000". Flask uses port 5000 by default.

3. Replace the api_key in app.py with your sandbox generated api key.

4. Create a USSD session, with the callback url set to the url generated by Ngrok after step 2

5. Create an SMS shortcode for testing. This will also be replaced in the code

6. Run the file app.py, and test with the simulator.
