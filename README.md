Here's the challenge for anyone hoping to join the June to August Technical Internship Cohort at Africa's Talking. 

## This challenge is due at 0900hrs EAT on 29th March 2019

## Simple Unchanging Rules
The code challenge is and will always be judged using the following criteria:
  - A Correct fork, branch and pull request
  - Using the GitHub Pull Request Time Stamp and correct code quality & structure, we unfortunately won't be able to consider any code challenge that goes over the timeline stated above.
  - Code quality and structure will be evaluated by the team
  - Do not share any code that you cannot opensource on the Git Repository as its open source and Africa's Talking will not be liable for any breach of intellectual property (if any) once shared on the platform.
  - Complete both challenges below

## Terms and Conditions
You can participate on as many challenges as you wish:
  - Do not share any code that you cannot opensource on the Git Repository as its open source and Africa's Talking will not be liable for any breach of intellectual property (if any) once shared on the platform.
  - Code Challenges are time bound - the time restriction is specified on the challenge
  - Additional rules MAY be provided on the code challenge and will vary for each challenge
  - You are free to use your tools of choice as long as they fall under the rules of the challenge as below
  - Only successful interviewies will be contacted for the next round of interviews

## Code Challenge Bounty:
  - A chance to work with some of the most brilliant minds in the world!
  
## Task 1
##### Those structures though...
##### Play around with these structures, make sure the logic and the approach are tight.

With the assumption that you are using an object oriented programming language, write a program that given hundreds of documents, can find all documents with words containing the letter "a" in them.

## Tips
###### Map then reduce
###### Comment your code to show your thought process
###### You can submit this as a file in your pull request named "task 1"


## Task 2
##### Send and validate
##### Play around with some of our products.

Create a simple USSD + SMS app that does user registration.

User journey: person dials the USSD Code and gets prompted for a username and email address. After which they get an SMS response telling them they've registered successfully

```

>Create a new branch as follows-> git checkout -b [your name], e.g.

```sh
$ git checkout -b roina_ochieng master
```

>See all branches created

```sh
$ git branch
* roina_ochieng
  master
```

>Push the new branch to github
